~~~VRCHEM README~~~

VRChem is a prototype application for molecular model building in virtual reality. Virtual reality provides greater depth perception over a regular display and can e.g. aid students in understanding the importance of three dimensional structures in chemistry. 

The self-extracting installer includes all necessary modules and settings and there should be no need for manual configuration.

A 4-minute tutorial is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2yuzdXad-k.

The application is developed for and tested on the original HTC Vive VR system. It might work on other systems but this hasn't been tested.
